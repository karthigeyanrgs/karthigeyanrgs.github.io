# Masters in Simulation Sciences (SiSc)

![RWTH Aachen University](/assets/img/RWTH-Aachen-University_500x500.jpg)

[**Masters in Simulation Sciences**](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/academics/masters-program-simulation-sciences) (SiSc) and [additional information](https://www.jara.org/en/research/center-for-simulation-and-data-sciences/school-for-simulation-and-data-sciences-ssd-en).

I have compiled my answers to some common questions directed at me. Some questions which could be answered by a simple search have been omitted. I would like to say upfront that I do not know the job prospects of any graduate program in RWTH Aachen apart from some pointers I received from my seniors. Also, please don't share your profile and ask me if you have a chance to receive admit, I am not qualified to answer it.

### Admissions and Requirements

**Q1) I don't know if it is true or not but there is speculation that in a Simulation science program at RWTH they provide admission to those only who have 9+ GPA irrespective of the overall profile. Is it true?**

_Ans_: I am quite certain that this is not true. Many people have their own perceptions, if you find yourself suitable for the program and you are interested in the course, don't hesitate to apply. There is no one size fits all, it is a very competitive program which looks at a holistic profile rather than just one elimination criterion.

**Q14) Level of proficiency in Programming and math?**

_Ans_: In order to be successful in the program, a good level of programming is expected in any one of the most utilized programming languages (C++ and Python). The transition wouldn't be hard. Math serves as the basis for most of the related work, work on your knowledge of numerical methods, calculus and linear algebra.

### Program Structure

**Q3) How often do we have classes in FZ J端lich and for how many semesters?**

_Ans_: If you are undertaking the "**engineering**" track, you would have classes in J端lich for a semester, one day of the week (it was Thursday for me). For those who opt the "**physics**" track, in the second semester, you need to spend two days a week in J端lich.

**Q4) I have read in the AICES website that the curriculum and the course is under reorganization and it would be under SSD soon (simulation and data sciences) would it mean that its association with RWTH is going to be affected?**

_Ans_: No, the association with RWTH wouldn't be affected. Just the funding structure is changing. It was under AICES previously with a collaboration with J端lich. The association still continues. The curriculum remains the same until now.

### Career Prospects

**Q2) I would like to enter the German market after my masters. I have absolutely no familiarity with German. Do you think it would be necessary?**

_Ans_: If you want to get into the industrial sector, it is recommended to have at least B1 level in German. But I wouldn't say there aren't any jobs involving only English as the form of communication and requirement. But in order to have a good work experience and social integration, it is imperative to have a good command of German. Of course, you can learn it while doing your coursework, but it is better to get a foundation back in your home country.

**Q9) I would like to pursue a PhD in the field of computational mechanics. would you think the knowledge gained in SiSc would be beneficial if I took appropriate subjs? How often do students take up Ph.D. after SiSc?**

_Ans_: Ideally, this master is a stepping stone for a PhD. Since most of the elements of the program are quite advanced, it takes more than 2 years to complete the program. Out of 5 people who have graduated with me this year, 4 of them have a PhD offer already. So it is quite common to venture to do a PhD.

### Companies & Job Prospects

**Q12) If you can list a name of a few companies students get to. I have heard CAME students get into AIRBUS, VW, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Daimler, ZF and other automotive MNCs. Is it the same for SISC grads?**

_Ans_: Some of my seniors are working in Audi, Aydern, Bosch and Norsk Hydro and DuPoint. Many of them have chosen to work in Software Startups. About 65% of them have opted to do a PhD or academic positions. My batchmates are working for ING, Ebay, Amazon and DLR to name a few.

### Research Assistant Positions

**Q20) How to obtain a Research assistant position in the first semester?**

_Ans_: During my master's, I worked as a research assistant (RA) at two different institutes and also worked on three different research projects. Though I tried relentlessly in my first semester for a RA position, none of the institutes wanted to offer work to a fresher. Being straight outta undergrad and having limited internship/fellowship experience, it would be justifiable to have very little success.

Enthusiasm doesn't only bear as a pillar of support, you need to reinforce it up with some experience too. I had a chat with one of my seniors on how to secure a RA position. He suggested back then, to try in the second semester, after having a strong hold on the first semester courses with a research project. To my surprise, I got the first research assistant position I applied to in the second semester, and the interview was a discussion rather than an array of standard questions thrown at you.
