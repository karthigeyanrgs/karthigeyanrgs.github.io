  <h3>Admissions and Requirements</h3>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q1: Is it true that Simulation Science program at RWTH only admits students with 9+ GPA?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      I am quite certain that this is not true. Many people have their own perceptions, if you find yourself suitable for the program and you are interested in the course, don't hesitate to apply. There is no one size fits all, it is a very competitive program which looks at a holistic profile rather than just one elimination criterion.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q2: What level of proficiency in Programming and Math is required?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      A good level of programming is expected in any one of the most utilized programming languages (C++ and Python). The transition wouldn't be hard. Math serves as the basis for most of the related work, work on your knowledge of numerical methods, calculus and linear algebra.

  <h3>Program Structure</h3>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q3: How often do we have classes in FZ J端lich and for how many semesters?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      If you are undertaking the <strong>engineering track</strong>, you would have classes in J端lich for a semester, one day of the week (it was Thursday for me). For those who opt the <strong>physics track</strong>, in the second semester, you need to spend two days a week in J端lich.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q4: Will the program's reorganization under SSD affect its association with RWTH?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      No, the association with RWTH wouldn't be affected. Just the funding structure is changing. It was under AICES previously with a collaboration with J端lich. The association still continues. The curriculum remains the same until now.

  <h3>Career Prospects</h3>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q5: Is German language necessary for entering the German job market?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      If you want to get into the industrial sector, it is recommended to have at least B1 level in German. While there are jobs requiring only English, good command of German is important for work experience and social integration. You can learn during your coursework, but getting a foundation in your home country is beneficial.

    <div class="faq-question">Q6: How beneficial is SiSc for pursuing a PhD in computational mechanics?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Ideally, this master is a stepping stone for a PhD. Since most of the elements of the program are quite advanced, it takes more than 2 years to complete the program. Out of 5 people who have graduated with me this year, 4 of them have a PhD offer already. So it is quite common to venture to do a PhD.

  <h3>Companies & Job Prospects</h3>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q7: Which companies typically hire SiSc graduates?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Some of my seniors are working in Audi, Aydern, Bosch and Norsk Hydro and DuPoint. Many of them have chosen to work in Software Startups. About 65% of them have opted to do a PhD or academic positions. My batchmates are working for ING, Ebay, Amazon and DLR to name a few.

  <h3>Research Assistant Positions</h3>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Q8: How to obtain a Research Assistant position in the first semester?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      During my master's, I worked as a research assistant (RA) at two different institutes and also worked on three different research projects. Though I tried relentlessly in my first semester for a RA position, none of the institutes wanted to offer work to a fresher. Being straight outta undergrad and having limited internship/fellowship experience, it would be justifiable to have very little success.<br><br>
      Enthusiasm doesn't only bear as a pillar of support, you need to reinforce it up with some experience too. I had a chat with one of my seniors on how to secure a RA position. He suggested back then, to try in the second semester, after having a strong hold on the first semester courses with a research project. To my surprise, I got the first research assistant position I applied to in the second semester, and the interview was a discussion rather than an array of standard questions thrown at you.
