Vanakkam üôè (Greetings in Tamil),

I started with core mechanical disciplines, finding my foot in fluid simulations with sufficient mathematical training. Delving deeper, I took up an interesting challenge of designing kinetic equations (mesoscopic) for unemployment using transport equations. I moved to non-technical line of work from ground up - Community and Growth manager, Customer Success Engineer to becoming the Head of Growth. After a year, I found my feet again at Ati motors doing what I am extremely passionate about - improving technology for humankind's benefit.

I am currently working on bringing robotics simulations closer to reality. Through Nvidia Isaac Sim, we are translating real world scenarios to the simulation framework and creating the near-perfect digital twins of the bots and environment wherein they are deployed.

  ## **Alternate Perspectives**

  I requested some of the people I know, what happens to be their perception of me. Because, honestly I wasn't quite sure of my own qualities.

  > "Someone who is reliable, generous, kind, intellectually honest, welcoming and accepting, curious about new things, and simply someone who **cares**. That last bit is so rare these days -- not just in caring about the people you work with, but caring about the details of what you do and how you do it. You're emotionally intelligent and empathetic. Two of the finest virtues. üôÇ"

  > "Karthig, you are such a pure human being. Of the time that I've had the pleasure of knowing you, I've seen nothing but goodness and curiosity and kindness in you (and little bit of nervousness too haha!). You amaze me every week as we work together with your work ethic, proactiveness and ability to learn fast."

  ## **Introspection**

  - I tend to enjoy Solitude. After all, one's mind is one's greatest company. :)
  - I speak less and tend to listen more.
  - My most comfortable medium of communication is writing.
  - I set boundaries for myself and rarely ask intrusive questions.
  - I love to help everyone in the best way I could.
  - I question everything around me. Curiosity is less outbound and more inbound.
  - I feel calm and composed in a natural setting.
  - I always think before I write or speak.
  - If I love someone, I tend to love them deeply and truly. :)
  - Memories are my biggest treasures. Not knowledge, money, or power.
  - Humour has always been my forte to handle situations. I am not politically, spiritually, or religiously inclined.

  ## **Skills/Habits**

  - Ability to remember numbers for more than a considerable duration
  - I only post positive content on my social media handles (_Twitter and LinkedIn_)
  - I tend to watch documentaries and uncharted media
  - I spend a good amount of my time reading others' works
  - I prefer meeting people in-person or through texts/emails

  ## **Principles**

  - I don't smoke or drink alcohol
  - I am a vegetarian
  - I don't cuss both online or offline
  - I'm punctual and value others' time
  - I reflect on the consequence of every one of my actions

  ## **Case Scenarios**

  - **When I'm angry**: I try to be rational about the situation. I usually turn silent and don't speak in the heat of the moment.
  - **When I'm happy**: I share this moment with my loved ones. I don't get overwhelmed with joy.
  - **When I'm sad**: I generally spend time alone in these situations.
  - **When I'm scared**: I divert my complete attention toward the source of it. I have acrophobia (_fear of heights_) which I am in the process of overcoming.
