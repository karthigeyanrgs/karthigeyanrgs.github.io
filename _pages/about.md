  Vanakkam 🙏 (Greetings in Tamil),

  I am a 27 years old graduate of RWTH Aachen, Germany. I hold a master's in Simulation Sciences. I will utilize this virtual space to share my honest reflections in a witty and personalized way.

  I tend to be quite inactive on Social Media. My social links below are my primary outlets, which equally split my attention.

  ## **Alternate Perspectives**

  I requested some of the people I know, what happens to be their perception of me. Because, honestly I wasn't quite sure of my own qualities.

  > "Someone who is reliable, generous, kind, intellectually honest, welcoming and accepting, curious about new things, and simply someone who **cares**. That last bit is so rare these days -- not just in caring about the people you work with, but caring about the details of what you do and how you do it. You're emotionally intelligent and empathetic. Two of the finest virtues. 🙂"

  > "Karthig, you are such a pure human being. Of the time that I've had the pleasure of knowing you, I've seen nothing but goodness and curiosity and kindness in you (and little bit of nervousness too haha!). You amaze me every week as we work together with your work ethic, proactiveness and ability to learn fast."

  ## **Introspection**

  - I tend to enjoy Solitude. After all, one's mind is one's greatest company. :)
  - I speak less and tend to listen more.
  - My most comfortable medium of communication is writing.
  - I set boundaries for myself and rarely ask intrusive questions.
  - I love to help everyone in the best way I could.
  - I question everything around me. Curiosity is less outbound and more inbound.
  - I feel calm and composed in a natural setting.
  - I always think before I write or speak.
  - If I love someone, I tend to love them deeply and truly. :)
  - Memories are my biggest treasures. Not knowledge, money, or power.
  - Humour has always been my forte to handle situations. I am not politically, spiritually, or religiously inclined.

  ## **Skills/Habits**

  - Ability to remember numbers for more than a considerable duration
  - I only post positive content on my social media handles (_Twitter and LinkedIn_)
  - I tend to watch documentaries and uncharted media
  - I spend a good amount of my time reading others' works
  - I prefer meeting people in-person or through texts/emails

  ## **Principles**

  - I don't smoke or drink alcohol
  - I am a vegetarian (_tried to be a vegan but cheese is sometimes irresistible_!)
  - I don't cuss both online or offline
  - I'm punctual and value others' time
  - I reflect on the consequence of every one of my actions

  I'm not against anyone having conflicting principles and wouldn't enforce my principles on others. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and their hygiene care.

  ## **Case Scenarios**

  - **When I'm angry**: I try to be rational about the situation. I usually turn silent and don't speak in the heat of the moment.
  - **When I'm happy**: I share this moment with my loved ones. I don't get overwhelmed with joy.
  - **When I'm sad**: I generally spend time alone in these situations.
  - **When I'm scared**: I divert my complete attention toward the source of it. I have acrophobia (_fear of heights_) which I am in the process of overcoming.
