 [**Masters in Simulation sciences**.](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/academics/masters-program-simulation-sciences) (SiSc) and [here](https://www.jara.org/en/research/center-for-simulation-and-data-sciences/school-for-simulation-and-data-sciences-ssd-en).

I have compiled my answers to some common questions directed at me. Some questions which could be answered by a simple search have been omitted. I would like to say upfront that I do not know the job prospects of any graduate program in RWTH Aachen apart from some pointers I received from my seniors. Also, please don’t share your profile and ask me if you have a chance to receive admit, I am not qualified to answer it.

* * *

**Q1)  I don't know if it is true or not but there is speculation that in a Simulation science program at RWTH they provide admission to those only who have 9+ GPA irrespective of the overall profile. Is it true?**

_Ans_: I am quite certain that this is not true. Many people have their own perceptions, if you find yourself suitable for the program and you are interested in the course, don’t hesitate to apply. There is no one size fits all, it is a very competitive program which looks at a holistic profile rather than just one elimination criterion.

* * *

**Q2)  I would like to enter the German market after my masters. I have absolutely no familiarity with German. Do you think it would be necessary?** 

_Ans_: If you want to get into the industrial sector, it is recommended to have at least B1 level in German. But I wouldn't say there aren't any jobs involving only English as the form of communication and requirement. But in order to have a good work experience and social integration, it is imperative to have a good command of German.  Of course, you can learn it while doing your coursework, but it is better to get a foundation back in your home country. 

* * *

**Q3) How often do we have classes in FZ Jülich and for how many semesters?**

_Ans_ :  If you are undertaking the "**engineering**" track, you would have classes in Jülich for a semester, one day of the week (it was Thursday for me). For those who opt the "**physics**" track, in the second semester, you need to spend two days a week in Jülich.

* * *

**Q4) I have read in the AICES website that the curriculum and the course is under reorganization and it would be under SSD soon (simulation and data sciences) would it mean that its association with RWTH is going to be affected?**

_Ans_ : No, the association with RWTH wouldn't be affected. Just the funding structure is changing. It was under AICES previously with a collaboration with Jülich. The association still continues. The curriculum remains the same until now.

* * *

**Q5) What were your interests when you chose the SiSc course? as in which field did you have an interest in venturing into and hence took SiSc. My interest is in Computational Mechanics- both fluid and solid mechanics and would like to explore a bit into the computing field as well. In that case I was not sure about the theoretical physics subjects offered by SiSc.....how it would help me build a career into fluid and solid mechanics just by taking electives. what shall be your opinion ? Will it be helpful for a student like me? CAME (another graduate program) had compulsory subjects which were of my interest but its electives I am not sure about. also SiSc had some electives in the structural mechanics part which were a little more advanced.**

_Ans_ : I was interested in Applied mathematics, particularly curtailing to Fluid mechanics.  Mathematical modelling was my primary reason to take up SiSc. In my opinion, I felt Quantum mech was essential to me since It answered many of the questions I had with regard to Physics. And it also strengthened my linear algebra. The program is quite diverse, a friend of mine only did courses from structural mech, some only did fluid mech while some like me did fluid mech and math. Some of them wanted to venture into computer science. It is very diverse, it entirely depends on your interest and how comfortable you are with the course. You have about a month before you need to register for a course. I don't have much idea about CAME or any other paid programs in RWTH to be honest. Also I feel the courses offered under structural mech are relatively easier than fluid mech courses. Fluid mech courses are pretty theoretical and it takes some time to have a hold of it.

* * *

**Q7) Can we take any extra credits/ electives over and above the recommended 120 credits? As I had an interest in solid and fluid mechanics I was wondering if I could take all the compulsory subjects of the CAME program but it would exceed the total allowable by about 10 to 12 credits.**

_Ans_: Oh yes you can audit them, but you will be only able to credit close to 120. And I have some batchmates who did some courses from CAME too, so it is fine.

* * *

**Q8) The courses can be done in the stipulated 2 years time or it takes more time?**

_Ans_: Normally it takes about 2.5 years, but one can never say. Many of them have taken 3+ years to complete too. Tenure of your coursework does not determine your value.

* * *

**Q9) I would like to pursue a PhD in the field of computational mechanics. would you think the knowledge gained in SiSc would be beneficial if I took appropriate subjs? How often do students take up Ph.D. after SiSc?**

_Ans_:  Ideally, this master is a stepping stone for a PhD. Since most of the elements of the program are quite advanced, it takes more than 2 years to complete the program. Out of 5 people who have graduated with me this year, 4 of them have a PhD offer already. So it is quite common to venture to do a PhD.

* * *

**Q10) What shall be the job prospects (which field and job profiles) after SiSc given that I have pretty good proficiency in German language?**

_Ans_: With B1 or more German proficiency, you stand a better chance at the job market for sure. I cannot predict how the job market is in the next two years per say. You stand at a very unique position after your chosen electives, and your targeted industry would determine that. Specific questions get specific answers.

* * *

**Q11) Is it possible to do a semester in another college for eg...doing the master thesis in another college or enrolling in some courses from other colleges of TU9 or even other colleges like ETH Zurich?**

_Ans_: Yes, ideally you could do the master thesis anywhere in the EU/EEA with an internal supervisor. Also courses as an Erasmus or a semester abroad to take up courses in other universities.

* * *

**Q12) Can we extend the course by some period of time ? If yes then can we take extra courses during that time and explore more or do mini thesis under some profs ?**

_Ans_: There is no stipulated time to complete the courses (bar 5 years and visa validity). The exam is offered almost every semester for most courses. You can take your time to complete a course. You can entirely drop out as well if you haven't registered for the exam. There is a lot of room for flexibility.

* * *

**Q11)  Is it common that SiSc students opt for industrial internships too ? If yes then what kind of industries are they preferred. Do they get opportunities in the simulation/CAE domain field of the company as well. I know it's a dumb question but I haven't heard anyone specifically working in this field in an industry. Also this would mean that the study would be extended by at least 6 months.**

Ans:  No, it is quite unlikely for SiSc students to opt for an internship since it isn't a requirement for us. Some people do internships, but mostly voluntary ones which span for three months. It is not a dumb question, the answer is it depends entirely on the HR department of the enterprise. Most of the HR are unaware about what simulation sciences entails, we need to mention computational sciences in the brackets. At least the way I see it, getting an internship here in Germany requires some form of experience in the field you are applying. You could do courses while doing an internship too. You just need to write the exams.

* * *

**Q12) If you can list a name of a few companies students get to. I have heard CAME students get into AIRBUS, VW, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Daimler , ZF and other automotive MNCs. Is it the same for SISC grads?**

_Ans_: Some of my seniors are working in Audi, Aydern, Bosch and Norsk Hydro and DuPoint. Many of them have chosen to work in Software Startups. About 65% of them have opted to do a PhD or academic positions. My batchmates are working for ING, Ebay, Amazon and DLR to name a few.

* * *

**Q13) I  would like to get my M.SC at RWTH on Simulation Sciences, Is it possible for me to ask some basics about this program and its requirements from you?**

_Ans_: [Simulation Sciences M.Sc. - RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY - English](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/Studium/Vor-dem-Studium/Studiengaenge/Liste-Aktuelle-Studiengaenge/Studiengangbeschreibung/~bnzu/Simulation-Sciences-M-Sc/?lidx=1)

This link would provide you with answers for your questions. If you have any other specific questions, feel free to ask me. Good luck for your application.

* * *

**Q14) Level of proficiency in Programming and math?**

_Ans_ : In order to be successful in the program, a good level of programming is expected in any one of the most utilized programming languages (C++ and Python). The transition wouldn't be hard. Math serves as the basis for most of the related work, work on your knowledge of numerical methods, calculus and linear algebra. 

* * *

**Q15) Is it possible to have a career in AI/ML or Data Science with the help of the SiSc program?**

_Ans_ : Yes, definitely it is possible. Many of my batch mates took elective courses in Computer vision, ML and NLP too. Have a clear picture on what electives you want and you have a month before you can register for them. Just attend the classes and see if it fulfils your requirement.

* * *

**Q16) How are the 1st year courses since I’m from a mechanical engineering background. How will I cope with subjects like quantum mechanics and other computer science subjects. Will they be useful if I choose structural mechanics electives? Also I’ll have to do them anyway since those are mandatory courses right ?** 

_Ans_ : Quantum mech will also revise your linear algebra too, and given the state of things, Quantum computing could be the next paradigm for High performance computing. Yes, they are mandatory, and helps in performing a plethora of simulations. If it isn't something you would like to do, you could look at the CAME course where they delve more into structural mech.

* * *

**Q17) How to organise my 1st semester? How is the study week like lectures? How many hours per day and how much free time do we get during the week and general workload?**

_Ans_ : There is no definitive answer to this. 1st semester will be very intensive to say the least. Not only the study schedules will be insanely long, also the bureaucratic overhaul will be nerve cracking. But after the first semester, you can put your foot on the ground and find your momentum. There is no generalized approach, but German exams are much harder than any semester exam I had back in India per se.

* * *

**Q18) What things should I review before starting the program?**

_Ans_ :  Revise your numerical methods, linear algebra and C++. This will smoothen your initial struggles. Get more experience in writing python codes the non-pythonic way  without importing libraries. Take a look at the various institutes, and try to forge some initial connections with PhD students in institutes of your choice.

* * *

**Q19) Any other things that you would like to suggest to have a fruitful experience.**

_Ans_ : One thing I greatly regret is making too few connections. Take this opportunity and make as many meaningful connections as you can. Keep an open mind, and you will do great in Germany. Good luck ! Feel free to ask if you need any further clarifications, also share relevant info to your batchmates too.

* * *

**Q20) How to obtain a Research assistant position in the first semester?**

  
_Ans_ : During my master's, I worked as a research assistant (RA) at two different institutes and also worked on three  different research projects. Though I tried relentlessly in my first semester for a RA position, none of the institutes wanted to offer work to a fresher. Being straight outta undergrad and having limited internship/fellowship experience, it would be justifiable to have very little success.

Enthusiasm doesn't only bear as a pillar of support, you need to reinforce it up with some experience too. I had a chat with one of my seniors on how to secure a RA position. He suggested back then, to try in the second semester, after having a strong hold on the first semester courses with a research project. To my surprise, I got the first research assistant position I applied to in the second semester, and the interview was a discussion rather than an array of standard questions thrown at you. But apart from the good money, you also get a sneak peak into your future environment if you delve into research.

To be quite honest, getting the second position was much easier than the first. I didn't even have an interview, for I just approached the professor after a particular lecture, and crisply told him how I could ease out some of the simulations he had in mind, and how they would help me too! Though it is quite tempting to seek out part time positions at the very moment you land in a new country, I strongly recommend against it due to the new environment and initial  reservations of your employers.

**Q21) I noticed that a major chunk of Simulation Science students have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and then major in CFD or computational mechanics. So I was just wondering if the program is in anyway biased towards admitting more mechanical engineering graduates? Do you think this program will be right for me if I primarily want to use it to shift to the high performance computing domain from a Physics background?**

_Ans_ : As for the answer to your question, yes, there has been too many mechanical engineers in the program, but worry not, I can tell you from my experience.  In my batch, there were 7 physicists, 3 from civil engineering, 2 from material science, 4 computer science students, 2 from aerospace and 4 from environmental engineering students. As you can see, despite having a chunk of engineers, there were pure science students too. In the second semester, you have the choice of either pursuing the "engineering track" or the "physics track". If you choose the physics track, your classes will be largely held in Jülich near a high performance supercomputing centre. From what I can see from my batchmates, physicists have been very successful in this program, far more than Engineers.

* * *

**Q22) Are you positive about the situation improving in the next few years? Will it be a good choice to come to Germany in these times?**

_Ans_ : The thing is global economy has dropped, so situation is going to worsen everywhere. But under my observation, Germany wouldn't fall too deeply. We still need to see whether it would be a good choice. I don't follow the markets too closely, but unemployment rates are generally high everywhere. The solace here is that they have a strong taxation system, so it wouldn't be an impossible task, difficult for sure. I would recommend you to do some data science related courses as well during your masters so that you could stand out better in the job market.
