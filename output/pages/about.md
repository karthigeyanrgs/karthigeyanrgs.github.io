Vanakkam 🙏 (Greetings in Tamil),

I am a 27 years old graduate of RWTH Aachen, Germany. I hold a master's in Simulation Sciences. I will utilize this virtual space to share my honest reflections in a witty and personalized way.

I tend to be quite inactive on Social Media. The below handle is my primary outlet, which equally split my attention.

I have added more about "**_myself_**" below for those who would like to know more. :)

## **Alternate Perspective**s

I requested some of the people I know, what happens to be their perception of me. Because, honestly I wasn't quite sure of my own qualities.

Please click this phrase if you would like to read it.

> Someone who is reliable, generous, kind, intellectually honest, welcoming and accepting, curious about new things, and simply someone who **cares**. That last bit is so rare these days -- not just in caring about the people you work with, but caring about the details of what you do and how you do it.  
> You're emotionally intelligent and empathetic. Two of the finest virtues. 🙂
> 
> \- Rishabh

> Karthig, you are such a pure human being. Of the time that I've had the pleasure of knowing you, I've seen nothing but goodness and curiosity and kindness in you (and little bit of nervousness too haha!). You amaze me every week as we work together with your work ethic, proactiveness and ability to learn fast.
> 
> \- Soundarya

> Man, you are a very strong guy and I can feel how much you been through. Kudos dude 👏 for ploughing through all this seriously.
> 
> \- Rahul

> I want to say kindness and empathy. And also not giving up. I still remember that time in MIRS one night where we were talking about how hard everything is, and at that point I don't remember what it was that you said, but I remember feeling so much better.
> 
> \- Rishi

> Compassion and empathy. Not saying those are the only qualities. But these are the clear standouts for me.
> 
> \- Akshay

> Besides your powerful biceps :p, I would say you are very empathetic. Also, you are willing to out you in uncomfortable positions. Without shying away too much. Besides what you might think, I believe you are quite sturdy emotionally.
> 
> \- Uriel

> In general, as a person, I would say you always have good arguments and also intuition. You are well informed and you are always willing to help others. You are also a good writer. And you are a good person, I don't know if that counts.
> 
> \- Konstantina

> Karth, I think if I have to pick ONE general thing that would be: determination. I honestly think that is your most valuable strength. So course there is the fact you are really good in fluid mechanics, but I think determination is your best strength. It is actually a mixture between determination and stubbornness, but they are always walking hand in hand.

> \- Rodrigo

> I think you have a lot of perseverance. Not many people do. Like if people get bored/frustrated they tend to move on. Which may be a good quality at times. But at other times you need to persevere. And that is something you have patience for which most people don’t.

**_There have been a few more, which were quite personal and extremely long :)_**

* * *

## **Introspection**

- I tend to enjoy Solitude. After all, one's mind is one's greatest company. :)

- I speak less and tend to listen more.

- My most comfortable medium of communication is writing.

- I set boundaries for myself and rarely ask intrusive questions.

- I love to help everyone in the best way I could.

- I question everything around me. Curiosity is less outbound and more inbound.

- I feel calm and composed in a natural setting.

- I always think before I write or speak.

- If I love someone, I tend to love them deeply and truly. :)

- Memories are my biggest treasures. Not knowledge, money, or power.

- Humour has always been my forte to handle situations. I am not politically, spiritually, or religiously inclined.

## **Skills/Habits**

- Ability to remember numbers for more than a considerable duration. If you are an important person in my life and I don't recollect your birthday, I am sorry to break it down for you.

- I only post positive content on my social media handles (_Twitter and LinkedIn_) and refrain from expressing my opinions on issues surfacing online or offline. Personal experiences have taught me a perennial lesson.

- I tend to watch documentaries and uncharted media. I spend a good amount of my time reading others' works.

- I prefer meeting people in-person or through texts/emails. I rarely watch the news. My family is my only source of information regarding the latest _trends._

## **Principles**

- I don't smoke or drink alcohol.

- I am a vegetarian (_tried to be a vegan but cheese is sometimes irresistible_!).

- I don't cuss both online or offline. Words have a lot of power to _uplift_ and _deter_ individuals. **Why not just use them to uplift?**

- I'm punctual. I value others' time and expect the same from others (unless of course unforeseen circumstances).

- I reflect on the consequence of every one of my actions. I tend to avoid aggressive individuals.

I'm not against anyone having conflicting principles and wouldn't enforce my principles on others. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and their hygiene care.

## **Case Scenarios**

- **_When I'm angry_**: I try to be rational about the situation. I usually turn silent and don't speak in the heat of the moment.

- **_When I'm happy_**: I share this moment with my loved ones. I don't get overwhelmed with joy, I rarely shriek out a roar (_only when the joy is overwhelming_).

- **_When I'm sad_**: I generally spend time alone in these situations. Sometimes rationality is thrown out of the window.

- **_When I'm scared_**: I divert my complete attention toward the source of it. I have acrophobia (_fear of heights_) which I am in the process of overcoming (_hiked mountains ~1850 ft and sustained for 1 hour on the 124th floor of Burj Khalifa_). I have overcome Thalassophobia (_deep water_) by snorkeling.
