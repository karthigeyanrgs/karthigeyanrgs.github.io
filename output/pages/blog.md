Hello! I'm Karthigeyan.  

_I have had too many nicknames_: Karthig|Karthik|KGS|Karthi|Karth|Karthu|Car-Tee|Swiss Army Knife|Karthigeya ;)

  
My name has been mispronounced, misspelled, and misused far more times than I could count. :D

  
I have a long-standing list of hobbies or [escapes](https://witfulmadrasi.wordpress.com/2021/03/02/my-experiments-with-escapism/) as I would like to call them.

_Writing is one of them_**.**

### Appreciation Board😊

I would like to showcase some of the heartfelt appreciation and love that I had received for my writing privately, here, in no particular order. I will continue to add more as they shower in! 🤗

> Karthig, your writing is honest and beautiful. I enjoyed reading it until the very end, along with the fun statistic! Escapism really is inevitable -- to some, it's drugs, to others, it's writing. I'm just glad you belong to the latter! Don't ever stop writing.

> I'm not the only one that enjoys it, for sure, many people has commented (personally) how they like to read what you write and how nice it is. So, at the end, if by publishing what you write you make someone happy, I think it's worth it.

> \- Uriel

> You are an excellent writer. 😅 You write and explain things well.
> 
> \- Raksha

> You're doing really great with your posts these days. One thing I notice though is that you sometimes sound apologetic. In case it's not deliberate, I wanted you to know that you don't need to apologize for your posts. From the reactions and comments, I can tell that people really appreciate what you're writing. You can own that :) Embrace your new status as a thought leader :)

Karthig! I want to read more \[Press here 😁\].

> I read about your pandemic experience. I am sorry that you had to go through all of that! I am super glad that you are in a happy place now. The articles were raw, well-written and witty. I am very happy for you! You managed to learn from your challenging experience, while still being true to yourself.

> I came across your post in my feed and I felt it was so brave of you to share whatever you shared on a platform where people always talk about their successes. Mainly because, I was in a situation like that and was totally relating, which thankfully I overcame recently.

> \- Gopalan

> It's great I must say, I think you spoke out my mind on this one, everything was quite similar and related to my experiences apart from PCA 😄. Would look forward to more.

> I love to reread your posts because of the only reason, it kind of teleports me to the space you had been mentioning about in all of them! It's just great, certainly keep soaring in, Anna! I would like to see you in anon becoming an Author writing about fusions of a turbulent yet beautiful life with some computational ingredients to it.

> This is very well written, thank you for sharing your experience with writing and maintaining a blog. Also, congratulations on keeping at it for a year! Your thoughts on how views and reach of your posts don't really matter in the long run if you truly enjoy the process is eye-opening.

> Karthu, I studied your post and enjoyed it word by word. So far i don't know that a poet is inside you. Thanks for revealing it. Your kanyakumari trip would be most memorable one.
