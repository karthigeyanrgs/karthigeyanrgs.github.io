"_Where were you when I needed you the most_?". Never in my life I had been asked this question (to the best of my memory), but if any of you would like to ask me this due to my absence in the blogsphere, my answer is an **intense stare**. No, I am not going to dodge this question, being readers of my blog you have every right to know why I took such a huge gap. I was not essentially barricaded by writer's block, since essentially I knew what I need to write upon, but rather irked by the following question. "_Why am I writing in the first place_?" Though I find writing to be very therapeutic and it is the only medium wherein I can vent out how I feel about things, what is the need to write it online, why not just maintain a personal journal? Yes, I did have a good support wherein many could relate to my story and some even took inspirations from my story (now I am starting to become a bad influence too) but I had been questioning myself along the lines of the above question repeatedly for many times. I do know for a fact that my writing contributed little to no gain in unfounded knowledge. After all, I am just sharing my experience, what could that contribute for advancement of the reader or better their lives. After some one-on-one sessions with myself, I realized that not everything one writes needs to add value. If even one person who reads lets out a chuckle and sent me a short message about the same, that would go a long way for me mentally. This is one of the reasons why I comment on many fellow writers on this platform, because one of the biggest motivators for us is validation of our work and gain insights from our readers. In hindsight, I do understand my blogs are rather verbose and most of us do not have much time at our disposal to able to read such long text. I have been thinking along the lines of this, but haven't reached an appropriate solution yet.

**Now, let us get back to our story.**

I ended the previous post with much anticipation when I revealed the well concealed secret. Perhaps some of you are wanting to know more, or why would anyone in their right mind take such a reckless decision. Here is a secret (not another one**!**), eight courses are totally doable in a semester if you can plan it right. You can guess within an instant how my excellence in time management would come to my rescue here (oh the irony**!**). Before I expand on my courses and my adept skills in sticking to a schedule, say cheese to the photo :D (credits to the Mexican dude who pulled out his photographic skills to capture such a candid shot)

Now where were we? Ah yes, courses, not of meals but of my program. I took the following courses :

1. Adaptive partial differential equations
2. Boundary layer theory
3. Fast iterative solvers
4. From molecular to continuum mechanics II
5. Introduction to scientific languages
6. Model based estimation methods
7. Parallel computing in computational mechanics
8. Simulation sciences seminar

If you guess rightly on what basis I have ordered and coloured my list, you will get a cookie (not those fake home-made machine manufactured cookies, but a virtually real one). Every week in this semester was jam packed with classes, I even had classes in the night until 20:00 and I miss it immensely now. My mind was on high alert back then, when I used to hustle between classes and manage to watch some football matches with my batchmates. I honestly wouldn't be able jot anything down back then, nor start a blog. Many of my batchmates helped me immensely, be it in assignments where we ranted about how incompetent the tutor was or, how incompetent we were and providing me motivation to move forward. We burned every hour of the friendly summer in libraries boorishly knocking our heads on our laptop when we encountered a bug (**read several bugs**). By we, I mean three of my friends and myself (Mexican man, Spanish\-Brazilian and Turkish dude). Can't help but wonder at the transition in the above sentence, pure American, American-European, kinda European and finally snobby Asian. Unlike the Hollywood cliché where the Asian kid is the most intelligent and always has answers on the tip of his tongue, I just had compilation errors and others were sniggering at me. Okie, not sniggering but my bugs were really novice. I made many rookie mistakes in coding, and our messiah (Julia-loving vim user) looked disapprovingly at me every time a new error popped up during compilation or runtime. But he was patient to say the least, and I even got featured in his thesis (for all the silly reasons :D).

Let me leave you hanging on the last image! It's so good to be back and tap random keys on my laptop. For your information, next would be a book review instead of my usual trekking mishaps adventures.
