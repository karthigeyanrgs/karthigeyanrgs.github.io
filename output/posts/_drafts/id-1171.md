#### **Amma**

```
Was this the first word I uttered?Did I meet your beautiful face first?Was I who led you to have sleepless nights?Sorry, my memory wasn't well-formed to answer that.But there is a high standing chance, A gorgeous thought, or a trusty surety, That any of these events happened serendipitously,With a copious amount of hope.How else can you love me effortlessly?I toiled your nights with my howl, For I had a poorly formed immunity,Which led both you and dad to keep me alive both inside out.Your sacrifices can never be compensated,nor do you expect us to repay it.Of what fortune do I hold, to have you as my ever so caring mother. There were moments, when I was heartless,agitated with my own self.Moments when I blabbered and fumbled,And outcry the injustice that fell upon me.But you always held the plenteous hope,even when I held none for myself.How did you manage to believe in me, Mom? I am so fortunate to have you always, Amma.You have been my biggest champion,Lauding me for my tiniest achievements,Which warranted no appreciation, or joy,it still boggles me how you made me happy about it.
```

## Love you, Mom.
