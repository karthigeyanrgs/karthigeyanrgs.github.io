Being part of a technologically-advanced modern society, we have progressed in automating mundane tasks but in turn digressed in retaining an acceptable attention span. Books of non-fiction and self-help genre have expanded extensively on how we remain discontent with our work outputs despite delivering to our "_absolute potential_".

Let's take a simple example. You head to your nearest bakery for a quick snack. You are left famished by the plenitude of choices essentially thrown at you. Should you go for a "_Chocolate donut with sparkles_" or any other 25 variants of a donut?

This term is coined as _"paradox of choices"_ \[[1](https://www.bsoundarya.com/work-from-home-challenge-at-present-inevitable-in-future/)\]. We are usually left baffled by each of this choice. I have written this article with an intention to declutter this space for a researcher who wants their research to reach out to the right audience.

Due to the development of non-traditional tools to grasp the essence from a long and tunnelled research paper, there has been a rise in the ability to communicate science _"better"_. Some of these non-traditional methods are :

- **Video** : "_A picture speaks a thousand words_". A video is a well defined sequence of pictures thus excelling this intend. If given a choice between reading a 1500-worded research paper or a three minute video, an average content consumer would choose the latter. This is an inevitable outcome. An animated video is a crisp compression of your research which would propel other individuals to be able to grasp the essentials of your work.
- **Podcast** : Several individuals have the propensity to work on less attention seeking chores while listening to podcasts. Podcasts help audiophiles listen and think deeply while listening to an audible form of a research paper. Authenticity of the researcher is well established when she/he/them can explain their research in their own words catering to listeners from diverse fields and backgrounds. The outreach is amplified to researchers and enthusiasts in other fields too who cannot comprehend the technical or contextual jargon present in a research paper.
- **Blog post** : Due to strict standards set by various journals, research papers must adhere to less creative visual forms. As a workaround, with the development of several webhosting services, one can communicate their ideas in a more visually appealing way. From animations, comics to graphic designing sky is the only limit to human creativity. A blogger can add more perspective to their research by adding story telling elements and making an informal outline of their research. The reader gets equally excited by the research work and can reverberate with the said article.

The underlying motif for the above methods is this : **to be able to demystify the complexity associated to one's and increase the engagement and adoption of one's work.**
