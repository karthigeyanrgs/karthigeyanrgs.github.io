I drew inspiration to animate conversations with myself, chronologically, after reading this beautiful [article](https://www.bsoundarya.com/10-lessons-i-would-teach-my-15-year-old-self/) by [Soundarya](http://bsoundarya.com).

I happen to turn 26 today.

I wanted to share some anecdotes from my life which I least talked about. By holding conversations with myself, I was able to identify my journey so far, empathise with my identity and hence gain comfort and peace.

I chided myself in the past for having enduring memories. I remember people I have met; their names, birthdates and events associated with them quite well. But, I have now come to the understanding that it was a blessing in disguise. I would be able to form deep connections with people I care about.

In the previous post, I gave a brief account of my father's mother. My other grandmother from my mother side, in contrast, helped me grow up by elucidating me with her own life experiences in the form of stories. She could recollect her most treasured memories right from infancy!

On the same nerve, I would like to articulate how I would have conversed with my past self as someone who has been through the intensity of the next course actions and suggest alternative school of thought. We are all a work in progress, there is never going to be a shortage of novel experiences or learnings that one would get to crusade through, during this journey of life.

Let's get started.

According to Thomas Armstrong, the celebrated author of ["The Human Odyssey"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486831809/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0486831809&linkCode=as2&tag=institute4l0e-20&linkId=acfa7ba70eff008b60d7c2ee5cfb1678) and an expert in human development balkanized life to [twelve stages](https://www.institute4learning.com/resources/articles/the-12-stages-of-life/) which he renamed as _"gifts"_. I will hold conversations to a few gifted versions of my life.

### 1\. Cynical, Oblivious (Childhood)

### 2\. Reticent, Shy and Guarded (Adolescence)

### 3\. Inquisitive, Amore and Placid (Adulthood)
