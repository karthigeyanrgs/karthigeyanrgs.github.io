I cannot express by words on how I feel about this nomination. For starters, I have never been nominated for any awards in my lifetime, nor have I received any awards. I would like to thank Mrs. Shruti for nominating me for this award. ([https://sillyshruti.wordpress.com/](https://sillyshruti.wordpress.com/)).

For people who don't know about Mrs. Shruti's works, now is you chance to explore. I always liked reading stories written with utmost honesty and could deliver its message clearly. To add to her stories, she included her various poems in her blog. For someone who can hardly write a haiku, I am very impressed by her writing skills. I thank you from the bottom of my heart once again.

And for the nomination procedures :

## **My Answers:**

**1\. Is blogging a profession or a hobby for you?**

Ans: Blogging has definitely been a hobby for me. I remember back in higher secondary school when I was asked to submit an essay regarding my dream vacation for the English course. My English teacher was quite happy with my writing, and that was the last time I can recall, wherein I got appreciated for my writing skills.

**2\. How many friends have you made from blogging?**

Ans: I started blogging quite recently, which surprised me further when I got this nomination. More than friends, I have encountered many bloggers I greatly admire. As for friends, I have managed to retain some of my friends by writing about my experiences :D

**3\. What activities inspire you to feel like you're living your life to the fullest?**

Ans: I do not have a definitive answer yet. As a curious mind, I keep exploring and experimenting with new activities.

**4\. Where do you see yourself in the next five years?**

Ans: I feel like I am being interviewed now, haha. In all seriousness, I live life in strides and do not make any long term plans.

**5\. Do you ever regret any of your posts?**

Ans: I do not regret any. But I have a feeling many of my readers do, after reading my content.

**Now is my second favourite activity. I get to nominate others for this award. I am pretty sure that most of them are nominated already. I actually want to nominate all the 89 blogs I follow, but since I cannot do that, I will name a few.**
