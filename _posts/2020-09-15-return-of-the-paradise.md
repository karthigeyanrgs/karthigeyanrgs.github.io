After some nail-biting back-to-back sequence of unexpected set of events in the previous [part](https://witfulmadrasi.wordpress.com/2020/09/01/now-thats-what-i-call-a-paradise/), let us delve in further into the misadventure of our central character, Car-tee. The purpose of the above title will be apparent shortly.

_Curtain opens pompously_

**Narrator** : You are an absolute **gem**! You guessed it right. Car-tee took the "_short_" detour to reach the above destination. How short you ask me? Just another 20 kilometres (12.5 miles). Not to worry about the fuel of this machine. White bread with a spoonful of Nutella spread and cucumber slices can suffice a weekend getaway, it is just a near 40 kilometres (12.5 \* 2 = \_ miles) hike under 32°c (89.6 °F for imperial folks) of happily radiating sun. This should be a piece of cake! (if only Car-tee had these many calories)

**Car-tee :** I am walking along the water body which I had seen from the other side. If I had a time turner I could wave at my former self, what a beautiful sight that would have been. Why is no one this particular trail? Don't they want to get to the magnificent Heimbach ?

**A random German couple :** (_hypothetical_) Jupp, but we have a car to get there. Only a fool would walk all the way from here. Our poor Sauran (_dog_ :D) wouldn't be able pass such ordeal and it has only one eye. _One doesn't simply walk to Heimbach_.

**Car-tee** : Challenge accepted!!

**A random German couple** : (_confused_) Did we challenge him? Never mind. Smile and wave.

**Narrator** : This is the only conversation that our dear bunny had, even though it was entirely in his head.

**Tell me again, how would one deny visiting such a place?**

**Car-tee :** Ah, Perfekt! Looks like this bench has been waiting just for me, for several years. Let me reduce the growling sounds from my stomach.

**Hey, bench. How you doi**n'? ;)

**Narrator :** What our dear little boy didn't know was that, he would only be able to replenish himself after several hours. _Water, Water everywhere, not a drop to drink_. (Spoiler alert!).

**Car-tee** : With this lunch, another 20 kilometres is totally doable. Might as well take another detour to make it 25? ;)

**Narrator** : Thank goodness our protagonist dropped this thought and proceed 3 kilometres in the "right" direction to realize that it was a dead-end. All wasn't bad for our boy since he captured the below shot. And walked back through the same way to his first incorrect judgement.

**One of my favourite clicks of the day! Look at the changing hue of the water due to light exposure.**

**Car-tee :** Let me proceed in this direction. There are even footprints and the way seems to be frequently pressed by human limbs.

**Narrator :** Wise conclusion despite all the wrong observations. He would make a terrible detective. Our character proceeded further for another ten kilometres and surprisingly came across a **road-block**!

What would **Car-tee** do next? Would he do a gravity defying leap over the bar and land with extreme ease and comfort. Or would our character be a law-abiding non citizen and walk back 10 kilometres back to his first "**misdirection**". Stay tuned to find out! Of course, let me know in the comments what would be your guess.

Stay inquisitive!
