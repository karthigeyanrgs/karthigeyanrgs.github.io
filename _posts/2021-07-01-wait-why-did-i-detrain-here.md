Perfect way to start writing in 2021, don't you think? I love the adversity associated to ill planning, venturing into unknown and facing challenges which could have been averted with a simple pre-plan. 2021 for the very same reason could span out to be a mere Deja vu but exciting nevertheless.

If this is the first time that you are reading my blogs, I pity and empathise with you. You must have ventured through the darkest form of web to get here. To the regular readers, no empathy can save you. It's almost common knowledge now that I spontaneously plan to visit a city purely out of my instincts.

On 19th May 2018, right when I got off my bed and threaded to morning chores a sane human would resort to, I checked the next train leaving to any destination within my semester ticket's vast applicability (_did somebody just say a "free" ticket?_). Within the expanse of the next hour, there was a train to Hamm and so began another adventure.

In hindsight, I should have at least checked the duration of travel from Aachen or the last train back home. But did I do that? The answer is in the tip of every reader's mouth. I arrived twenty minutes before the train departs to just get familiar with the train and it's "atmosphere" (_wait what?_). This was a solo travel for obvious reasons, nobody in their right mind would do this. Or maybe I haven't found anyone who would sign up for this yet (_convergence for this search tends to infinity_).

The initial plan while I boarded this train : head to Hamm (_primarily for the ham/hamm joke, wait till you hear the Essen one_). What was oblivious to me then is the very fact that it would take 3.5 hours to reach this destination! While I comfortably settled down onto my seat, I crossed out my checklist for this travel :

- A bottle of water, enough to remain hydrated but not more than what would make me wreck my shoulders.
- A "light" snack comprising of bread and butter (made of vegetable fats as told by my German roommate).
- My dear camera with enough fuel for it to last the day and an empty memory (sorry for erasing your memory, it was crude but necessary).
- Something to keep myself entertained throughout the onward and return journey.
- An internet connection.
- Have more than a laughable phone battery of 48%

First things first, I switched to "**Ultra power saving mode**" for my phone though my phone was as good as dead. I searched emphatically in my baggage for some solace. Perhaps there was something which would enforce my survival, something, anything. And there rested that "golden ticket" wrapped neatly in the laptop compartment of my bag. Yes, you guessed it right, it was a research paper and two pens. You might as well have asked me, "**Why not have a casual chat with one of your fellow passengers ?**". Pffftt, the answer is going to be amusing so I am going restrain answering that.

Anyways, for the next hour I was skimming through the paper to get a brief idea onto what it would like to convey, after which I was wearied out. Reading in a train needed some training, which I would religiously undertake the next semester. I did what I usually do when my mind wanders, I started doodling on blank side of the page. After close to 90 minutes, my curiosity took the better of me when my eyes were transfixed onto the telescreen displaying the station arriving next. Announcer's voice pompously announced the arrival of "**Wüppertal**". There it is, the battle cry : "**This is Sparta**" vibes. I don't exactly know why I was excited to disembark here, I believe that his excitement which lacked for any previous station played a huge part to it.

I pave my way out of the station which was an embodiment of a typical station with much less glamour. You wouldn't want to spend a minute within the station without a reason. And behold the sight before me, a backwerk (_affordable coffee shop, great hot chocolate if you ask me_). What followed the backwerk was a never ending street (_a mere exaggeration_) bounded on both the sides with shops. The ones I had no idea existed or the ones I didn't really care about. After strolling for a bit, navigating through the crowd, I came across a "pristine" sight.

The museum stood majestically before my very eyes - what a sight to behold. My feet involuntarily prodded to the entrance of this museum ([Von Der Heydt Museum](https://www.von-der-heydt-museum.de/home.html)). Being a frugal person, the entrance fee made me drift back the direction I had entered. Yes, yes, I know what you will be trying to convey to me, money should be spend on experiences. I agree with you now, but back then I would have mildly disagreed with you.

Nudging this little thought back then, I proceeded to explore Wuppertal. I ended up at the museum entrance despite my various manoeuvres. Either I was making circles or the aura broadcasted by the museum was very alluring. The former seemed more plausible, so I proceeded in the other direction and there was an acute slope.

AN ACUTE SLOPE

Right in the middle, slowly exhausting me with every step. Up until the very boss of it all..

After expending every ounce of energy left within my grasp, I finally reached the _high ground_. Before me, this graffiti stood tall. Was this extraordinary climb worth it ? Yes! Who wouldn't want to treat their eyes with such a graffiti? Jokes apart, the very reason for this climb was the **[Schwebebahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwebebahn_Wuppertal)** (_floating tram_) !!! Sounds terrific right? Hear the original name "_**Einschienige Hängebahn System Eugen Langen**_". I am going to leave you in the dark regarding its translation. All you need to need to know is that it is exquisite.

Let me tell you something which would blow your mind. It didn't cost me a dime to travel by this beauty! If I remember correctly I used this service about twelve times in a single day. To add to the excitement associated with this train, here are some pictures I had clicked.

Fair question to ask : Twelve times seems like a stretch, why take it so many times in a single day? The answer being I am fascinated by little things in life. Especially when they do not burn a hole in my pocket. But this wasn't my only reason, the tram stopped at stations which were very very curious! In the middle of a park for starters. One of the stations was located close to my life's sole purpose.

All my life, I wanted to be accepted into a secretive cult. Think about this, you are doing something so exciting that you turn invisible. No identity in this society whatsoever. No visas, border control or stupid laws. But alas, this was just Vienna house (_a hotel for the rich_). With head sunken, and a new purpose in mind I headed out. To add to the travesty, I came across a statute of a person doing a handstand with his briefcase. I am not going to entertain a trailing thought associated to this statue. As I explored further, I loved Wuppertal much much more. There isn't a particular reason why I loved this place. After such a blissful time, I headed back to Aachen with a satisfied smile and 46 percentage battery on my phone.

As I plugged in my earphones and played my favourite playlist comprising primarily of Taylor swift and Eminem. Two and half hours back to Aachen, I recollected every little road which I mistook to be the right turn, unsung landmarks in this city and the floating train. Nothing beats a day without the internet. I for one share a love-hate relationship with the internet. I wouldn't know if Hamm would have been this exciting, McDonald's served them anyways (_bad pun_).

**It took me ~8 hours to write and edit this particular blog. I hope you enjoyed reading it. To add to my curiosity and reduce reader's reading time I will convert this to an audiobook version. Stay tuned while I figure out the nuances of audacity. The audio version is available below.**
