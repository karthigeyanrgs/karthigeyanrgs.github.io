<p>My grandfather had a tape recorder which was one of his precious possessions. Each and every day until he was bedridden, he used to switch it on and listen to the sound waves radiating from this apparatus.</p>

<p><strong>A Tape Recorder.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thattravelblog?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dave Weatherall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tape-recorder?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></strong>)</p>

<p>Apart from the cassettes that contained devotional music, he used to listen to the recordings of my voice. <strong>Right from me singing, uttering unintelligent things to repeating prayers.</strong> I don’t remember the songs or the prayers but I have managed to somehow recollect this rather hazy memory.</p>

<p>On similar grounds, I am also able to remember all the mythological stories that my grandmother recited to me. Memories tend to be long-lasting when formed with people who have had a deep and constant impact in one’s life.</p>

<p><em>Without much hesitation, both of my grandparents always boasted to others that I was their favourite grandchild, and this post is a dedication towards their love for this device and me.</em></p>

<p>I recognized the analogy between life, and a tape recorder within this green space in an idyllic environment. After a 11 km walk, I found this beautiful location to reflect and reminisce through my sweet memories.</p>

<p><strong>Nature helps bring clarity to one’s thoughts.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How did I get here in the first place?</strong></p>

<p>Answer to this is foreseeable. A long standing article wouldn’t be necessary if we arrived at <em>“our”</em> destination promptly. Reminds me of the following quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s the not the destination, It’s the journey.”</p>

  <p>- <strong>Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliot was inspired by Emerson and wrote <em>“The journey, not the destination matters.”</em> Now that we know our destination, let us walk through the journey.</p>

<h2 id="rewind-">
<strong>Rewind</strong> ⏪</h2>

<p>As we press the rewind button on our virtual tape recorder, we find ourselves to be transported back on this particular date: <strong>14th September 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s been two years since I had taken a vacation. As coincidental as things can get, on 15th September 2019, I along with my sister went on an Europe trip for two weeks. The trip [very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Schengen</a> friendly!] started in Aachen where I was previously located. Proceeding further to Paris, Annecy, Chamonix, Interlaken, Munich, Garmisch-Partenkirchen and bringing a cyclic end back at Aachen.</p>

<p>While this story warrants another series of articles altogether, one of the major thematic revelation to me personally was this: <strong>my sister was an excellent planner and enjoyed this process immensely.</strong> Hence my decision was sporadic. I should definitely ask her to plan this vacation as well. But, alas, she was the intelligent one, as she has always been.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impression of Pondicherry.</strong></p>

<p>For a change, she wanted me to get along with the planning for at least the first week of the two week vacation (<em>Excellent planners always make the job so difficult for spontaneous wanders like me</em>). Here is how I phased out my vacation:</p>

  <li>First two days will be spent along with sister.</li>
  <li>Remaining days can be planned spontaneously.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that I had an extensive plan phased out, all I needed now was a location. I had a close ended list of candidates which like my plan was very well thought-out. I chose Pondicherry after eliminating the other candidates due to distance to travel, cost and finally the most important factor – open to flexibility for a spontaneous traveller.</p>

<p>All I did for the next two weeks was to book my initial accommodation for the first two days I would be spending with my sister, and another Airbnb near Auroville for a day and finally the tickets for the onward journey. Work took the better of my waking hours since we are close down on some critical tasks for my two jobs. <strong>A lot was at stake for the two weeks workwise, and to the dismay of my sister, I planned so little for our little getaway.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s progress to the day of travel. <strong>To house our first novel experience, my sister and I travelled in a cabin during our onward train journey.</strong> We have never travelled in first class in a train and wanted to give the best kickstart to our journey together after two years.</p>

<p>Once we reached the station, we boarded the train onto the coach named <em>“H1”</em> and settled down onto our seats. The first thing both my sister and I noticed: <strong>this isn’t a cabin!!</strong> We shelled a bit of coin to get a normal sleeping bed equipped with an AC. That’s atrocious! Few minutes later, a couple entered our berth and continued to explain to us that we occupied their seats.</p>

<p>Panic sprang through our spine. What if we boarded the wrong train? To our relief there was an additional coach way ahead named <em>“H1A”</em>.</p>

<p>Perfect! We settled onto our seats which again wasn’t much of an upgrade from the previous one. Just when we started to get over the feeling of being cheated, a group entered our berth and proclaimed that we have occupied their seats.</p>

<p><strong>Not again!</strong></p>

<p>We approached the travel ticket inspector who asked us to proceed much further forward section of the train. I thought to myself “<em>Is he asking us to sleep in the engine room?</em>” :D</p>

  **Oh look, its us again.**

  </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And to our delight, there laid private cabins!!</strong></p>

<p>A cabin which housed four individuals within its vicinity. Our co-passengers were a couple who never stopped talking to us until bedtime. They spoke about movies without breaking a sweat! My sister and I being patient listeners, heard to every one of their little experiences and inserting flavour to our conversation at the right moments.</p>

<p>Since we were travelling to the same destination, Pondicherry, we exchanged our itineraries. I for one had absolutely no plan whatsoever.</p>

<p>The two days progressed so quickly that I didn’t have a moment to pause and reflect about the same. We managed to strikethrough everything that Pondicherry or more beloved called as <em>“Pondy”</em> had in store.</p>

<p><em>We singed on top of our voices, woke up early to almost catch the sun rising, ate at exotic locations serving one of the best foods and most importantly created memories that would hold traces in our brain as long as we exist in this beautiful world.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While most of what we did was spontaneous due to the irk I hold towards holding a travel checklist, our <strong>serendipitous</strong> weekend getaway was the most rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/img_20211003_072410.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Discarding a comment on my height, we are so minuscule compared to the magnanimity of nature.</p>

<p>It was time to bid adieu to my sister as I continued my vacation alone for the week ahead.</p>

<p>One can derive great joy from doing several things. <strong>But, I realized during my vacation that, one can derive great joy by doing nothing</strong>. Several times we utter too many words, display too many emotions and mark down too many goals but still end up wanting for more.</p>

<p>To me this was an important revelation. I shuffle through a lot in work, and immerse myself through it that I don’t exactly appreciate the little things that happen around me. It is so easy to take things for granted, and one cannot feel the importance of an entity until it is lost.</p>

<p>I layered my reflections for the next few days as I stayed in <a href="https://auroville.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Auroville</a>, Chithambaram and finally my home city Madras, bringing my solo trip to a close.</p>

<h2 id="contemplate-️">Contemplate 🧘🏾‍♂️</h2>

<p>To anyone who knows me too well, they do know that I introspect and spend more time in solitude. I do enjoy the company of others but it taxes me quickly. If I were to encapsulate the next few days into a quote, I will choose my favourite one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best and most Beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched – they must be felt with the heart.</p>

  <p>- Helen Keller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will break down my train of thoughts into different sections to cater to different <em>“wheels”</em> of life reflected at different checkpoints of my journey.</p>

<h3 id="walk-️">Walk 🚶‍♂️</h3>

<p>Walking is my favourite physical activity. I push myself to the extremes when it comes to challenging myself on the grounds of walking. Last I challenged myself was a hike of 36 km which I accomplished in 7.5 hours during my time in Germany (more on that <a href="https://witfulmadrasi.wordpress.com/2020/09/01/now-thats-what-i-call-a-paradise/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <figure>
    
  ![](/assets/img/posts/img_20211004_140526.jpg)
    
  <figcaption>
    
  **I instantly fell in love with this path.**

  <figcaption>
    
  **And this one too :)**
    
  </figcaption>
    
  </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And I was up for another challenge. Get to Auroville and back to my Airbnb with just water as my replenishment. The walk was 22 Km long when circled through, and hence I felt that it was extremely doable. I absolutely discounted the scorching heat during peak summer, my physical fitness levels and my frugal mindset.</p>

<p><strong>How Frugal?</strong></p>

<p>I left my wallet in the Airbnb. Yes, when I challenge myself, I push myself to the extreme. With my camera, phone and a bottle of water I headed on my planned walking action plan. One of reasons why I consider walking to be my favourite is the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.”</p>

  <p>- Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I agree to the above quote wholeheartedly. My mind cycled through several moments of my life while recognizing the need to stay in the present. I only took a break once I reached Auroville. And here is when we reach to the start of this post. Yes, I reached the location where I reflected about many things in my life, trying to answer some of the questions which have rented my mind without paying a rent.</p>

<p>I spend more than two hours here during which a good twenty minutes on a call with my dear friend and Employer, Rishabh.</p>

<p>Auroville apart from inducing an intentional, radical and free thinking society also provided free and fresh water. I refilled my bottle and explored a bit more, venturing into restricted sections as I walked through another route unknown to most (<em>including myself, thanks to my curiosity I found this pathway :D</em>).</p>

  **Yes, onto Solitude we head!**
    
  </figcaption>
    
  </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And while heading back, I started to feel the aftereffects of intense heat. Thanks to the tender coconut seller on my return journey, who replenished my hydration levels to normal and hence clearing my head from any form of discomfort.</p>

<p><strong>How did I pay for the tender coconut?</strong></p>

<p>You will have to wait to find out. :)</p>

<p>Let me leave you, my reader with a cliff-hanger (<em>not really, if you think through this</em>).</p>

<p>The other three sections to cover, which I reflected upon are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧</li>
  <li>Memories 💭</li>
  <li>Titles 🎓</li>
</ul>
