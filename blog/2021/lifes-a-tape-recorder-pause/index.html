<p><em>This narrative is a continuation of a previous post which can be accessed <a href="https://wp.me/pc7re9-o9" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>It’s been several months since we last met. How about we jog through our memory together, shall we?</p>

<p>Highlights from the previous story:</p>

<p>Solo vacation of sorts.</p>

<p>Pressed the “Rewind” button in Auroville.</p>

<p>My impeccable “planning” skills</p>

<p>Wait, Karthik, these weren’t the highlights! Didn’t you mediate inside a cave for a week, fight a bear empty-handed, and dance with the mermaids.</p>

<p>Sorry to disappoint you, my dear reader, but <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, if you are looking for any profoundness or insightful writing, I wouldn’t want to take another 8-10 minutes of your time. Press the “x” next to this tab and listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi2cURoOAYY" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">live concert performance</a> from Adele.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>You didn’t leave?</p>

<p>Thank you! Let’s get back to our story. Straight to the supposed “<em>cliffhanger</em>” first.</p>

<p>I carried a phone with me. India has been very progressive on the digital payment front, and my frugal blunder was saved face by a digital payment app that I had previously installed.</p>

<p>And that’s exactly how I paid for the tender coconut!</p>

<p>Though I must say, the interpretations from the readers right from trading a story for a drink to providing marketing ideas were generous. As most know putting money where the mouth is, tops all of these short-term benefits. :)</p>

<p>I skipped past this previously, but let’s talk about the two hours I spent in Auroville right before I headed back to my place of stay. There were three things on the top of my mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧</li>
  <li>Memories 💭</li>
  <li>Titles 🎓</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s address them one at a time, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="people-">People 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</h2>

<p>I had always felt like I was never a people person. It took me an unnatural amount of time to get over this notion I had of myself.</p>

<p><em>Slow down</em>, Karthik. What do you mean by a <strong>people person</strong>?</p>

<p>Were you not comfortable conversing with people? Did you feel insecure in the presence of strangers?</p>

<p><em>…. Are you asocial?</em></p>

<p><strong>No, no, none of this</strong>. As the definition goes, people’s person is someone who is very outgoing and makes social connections effortlessly.</p>

<p>Based on all my previous experiences, I labeled myself to be anything but a people person. If any, I was more inclined to name myself as someone who was avoided by everyone around them a.k.a <strong>avoidant</strong>.</p>

<p>I had my rationale to believe this since I felt that it had been the case for me up until recently. My mind was mentally prepared to be ignored by every person I had ever met.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a forced action but an <em>instinctive</em> reaction.</p>

<p>One can train can their mind through several explicit methods, but it always was such an <strong>uphill battle</strong> to prance over this mental obstacle.</p>

<p>But, was this mental obstacle formed recently?</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong> It’s like lego blocks, with each block strongly magnetizing the other strongly.</p>

<p>I remember very well when the foundations were first laid down.</p>

<p>I need to take you down memory lane. Things aren’t going to be very pleasant, I would recommend you to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbJcQYVtZMo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a happy piece.</a> (my favorite one, it always manages to induce a sense of happiness in me)</p>

<p>This harks back to my younger days. More specifically the early to mid-teens. My mid-school started with me being a <em>demure</em> and my high school digressed with that of a <em>recluse</em>.</p>

<p>All the experiences and the little dots that led to this transformation had been well etched in my memory like it was just yesterday.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit about my demure experience in the first segment of <a href="https://witfulmadrasi.wordpress.com/2021/02/09/im-tired-of-everything/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this post</a>. Without reiterating much from that post, the sole focus point had been bullying which led to mistrust, solitude, and abstaining from forming any deep relationship with anyone who isn’t my <em>family</em>.</p>

<p>I wanted to run away whenever someone wanted to get closer to me.</p>

<p>What if they were just doing it with some ulterior motive in their mind? What if I was just a tool they needed in order to accomplish one of their goals in life? What if they took this as an opportunity to learn more about me to mock me further?</p>

<p>Every day was a struggle back then.</p>

<p>Imagine being the only soldier on the field with <em>no weapon</em> of your own against armies that want to <strong>go ballistic</strong> and employ every cheap tactic possible to bring your guard down and make you feel so little of yourself.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, <strong>I made no friends or acquaintances in this period</strong>. Back then, my only company during the mandatory school hours where I was being tossed like a ball among different ethnic groups, had been <em>books</em>. &lt;3</p>

<p>And this has been my best friend up until this day and has held my forte through my <em>frustrations, helplessness, and unfulfilling morbid thoughts</em>.</p>

<p>Things started to take shape on a positive quadrant when I entered college. I wrote a bit more about this shift in this <a href="https://witfulmadrasi.wordpress.com/2021/03/02/my-experiments-with-escapism/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post about escapism</a>. But I still felt that something was amiss. I was holding myself from forming a deep friendship with anyone.</p>

<p>Most termed me as a closed, shy, and stubborn individual. I was neither. I just didn’t want to open up to anyone around me. There were <em>countless</em> thoughts in my head but it was all just held there.</p>

<p>This pattern repeated when I started my master’s, but call it either the level of helplessness in a new country or meeting more diverse people which led me to shed a few of my boundaries.</p>

<p>I was able to add a few more to my circle and call them <em>friends</em>.</p>

<p>Friends who didn’t expect anything from me apart from my <em>time and attention</em>. My notion of ignorance bias didn’t leave me yet, since it managed to somehow deeply root itself inside me.</p>

<p>I still kept my distance.</p>

<p>Things did get better on the people front up until the pandemic struck.</p>

<p>During this time I read <em>“Who will cry when you die”</em> by Robin. It did help put the people around me in a better light. It helped me shed some boundaries with a few people I met who I am fortunate to call now close friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s the point of triumph if you’ve no one to share it with?</p>

  <p>Jeffrey Archer in “A Prisoner of Birth”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then, like <em>trophies</em>, I have been collecting people in my life <strong>who would cry when I die.</strong></p>

<p>I will sum up what people who I call friends in my life, mean to me in the words of Jane:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.”</p>

  <p>― <strong>Jane Austen</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Why don’t we switch topics to something I have little to no idea about – relationships. Quite specifically <strong>romantic relationships.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, yes!! It’s getting spicy now! :D</p>

<p>No, not so much. My cooking is far more spicier and seen much more. :P</p>

<p>Only the clueless can be ardently curious and inquisitive about things that stay as a piece of common knowledge to others.</p>

<p>Whenever I get to meet couples, which is not been a lot, I try to understand the psychology behind them trying to stay together in the first place. <em>What was the attracting factor? How did they stay hooked on each other?</em></p>

<p>There were so many questions, but so <em>few answers.</em></p>

<p>The best way to answer them is to set up an <strong>experiment</strong> which I later did. I learned more about human psychology than relationships through my experiment. 🙈</p>

<p>For those who didn’t know, I set up <a href="https://karthigeyan2.notion.site/Date-Karthik-Date-O-485cdaaa4e3645d2928ccb1d497cd63b" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a dating profile of my own</a> and also a template for others to set one for themselves. In the initial days, I garnered interest from my own friends who either <em>liked the idea or ridiculed it.</em></p>

<p>While the idea in itself didn’t work out, <a href="https://www.notion.so/karthigeyan2/Dating-Profile-Template-ce1b915de09a4c0683b1989b8028ac2e" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the template</a> was duplicated by more than <strong>60 people</strong>! This is something very positive out of the effort involved.</p>

<p>What did I learn about psychology from this? Precisely this quote from Rumi:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”</strong></p>

  <p>Rumi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me recollect a conversation I had with a couple who are destined to be together and live for/with each other. During the initial stages of their relationship, they had sought my opinion on how they should proceed further. (What an irony right? :D)</p>

<p>I spoke to them along the lines of <em>chemistry</em> right from balancing chemical reactions with the right amount of reactants to finding the “catalyst” which fosters their relationship. After hearing my 30-minute lecture, they were far more baffled than they were before they asked me. :D</p>

<p>Thankfully they sought counsel elsewhere and are happily married now.</p>

<p>This particular incident got me into reading more about relationships and here’s my framework which is less chemical and more mathematical. :D</p>

Types of Romantic Relationships.

</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>I am sure most of you are familiar with set theory. Let us assume the two people in a relationship to two set A and B. I am assuming monoamourous (involving two people) relationship firstly to simplify things and set the context.</p>

<p>Most of us are aware of the types shown in the above video. <strong>What would you term as the most ideal relationship for yourself?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Balanced</strong> has been a clear predominant in eastern philosophies, where the intersection of interests isn’t a null set.</p>

<p><strong>Aligned</strong> is the one most people wish for, the more common word being “soulmate”. Mathematically it would be either A or B with some outliers.</p>

<p><strong>Dominant</strong> and <strong>Segregated</strong> are the extremes to which no one would want to subject themselves to, but are sadly left with no choice. The mathematical implication is apparent.</p>

<p>Let’s leave “explorative” and “polyamorous” alone because frankly, I still have no clue about the ideology behind them. It takes immense effort, time and energy to maintain one meaningful relationship. I cannot see myself taking more in and dispersing the love I have from one to many.</p>

<p>If you ask me what would be an ideal relationship to me?</p>

<p>I would say any one of the above could be based on how the <em>people treat each other during their relationship.</em></p>

<p>And with that, I am drawing the curtain on romantic relationships. Looking at how little I have to speak about them, <em>you can second guess how many people I got to meet on these grounds.</em> ;)</p>

<p>But it is all well set and done. With ignorance, we can achieve only so little.</p>

<p>Now that I know what is lacking in the first place, I can improve on that front. Until then I will continue to be a <strong>third-wheel and love guru to other relationships around me</strong>. XD</p>

<p>And perhaps, I will get to say the below quote to someone in my life in the future. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”</p>
