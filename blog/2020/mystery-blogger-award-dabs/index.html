<p>The Mystery Blogger Award is an award for amazing bloggers with ingenious posts. Their blog not only captivates; it inspires and motivates. They are one of the best out there, and they deserve every recognition they get. This award is also for bloggers who find fun and inspiration in blogging; and they do it with so much love and passion.</p>

<p>This award was originally created by Okoto(<a href="https://www.okotoenigmasblog.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.okotoenigmasblog.com/</a>). I went through his blog, if you have a knack for fashion, lifestyle and travel make sure to head there. As for me, I am as unfashionable as one can imagine (perhaps that can be a fashion trend).</p>

<p><em><strong>RULES FOR ACCEPTING THE AWARD:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Display the award logo on your blog.</li>
  <li>Thank the blogger who nominated you and provide a link to their blog.</li>
  <li>Mention Okoto Enigma, the <a href="https://www.okotoenigmasblog.com/my-greatest-creation-yet/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">creator of the award</a>.</li>
  <li>Tell your readers 3 things about yourself.</li>
  <li>Answer 5 questions from the nominee.</li>
  <li>Nominate 10 – 20 bloggers.</li>
  <li>Notify your nominees by leaving a comment on their blog.</li>
  <li>Ask your nominees 5 questions of your choice, including 1 weird or funny question.</li>
  <li>Share the link to your best post</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope the above list is unsorted, since I am not known to follow order. I was nominated for this award by K who’s virtual home lies in (<a href="https://milliondreamshome.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/mystery-blogger-award/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://milliondreamshome.wordpress.com/</a>). As the name of the blog suggests, it is home to million dreams (I presume K meant the million neurons which form our dreams, correct me if I am wrong). Unlike my predictable structure of storytelling, you will find real talent and creativity there. Zie (to stay gender neutral since I am not entirely sure) ventures into various themes to complement zim’s creative mind. I am truly blessed to be nominated by such a diligent soul, perhaps my blog doesn’t provide enough justice to your nomination. But I will try my best to improve :D. Thank you so much for your nomination, means a lot to me.</p>

<p><strong>Three things about me :</strong> (Honestly wouldn’t know if anybody would want to know)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I like getting lost in cities with no pre-learned knowledge about them. Sounds stupid right? I love to visit museums, and stare at an artefact for hours together.</li>
  <li>I play table tennis decently. Though I tend to miss easy shots, and take the impossible ones.</li>
  <li>All my blogs are written by a bot. (just kidding, or maybe not)</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions to be answered from K:</p>

<p>1. What is your weakness?</p>

<p>Oh no! This going to be thesis altogether, you should have rather asked me about my strengths which could fit in a line. In all seriousness, many people have told me this, that I am too kind. Though I do not see it as a weakness, many incidences in my life have proven otherwise.</p>

<p>2. If you could buy only 3 things what would you buy?</p>

<p>I am a frugal person. If I had to buy only three things, then I wouldn’t buy any.</p>

<p>3. What’s the one song that actually gets you? (<em>Getting new song recommendations</em>)</p>

<p>This one is hard, since there are many songs that actually get me. Since I answered the previous question in few words, I will be more verbose. The first one I would recommend is “September song - JP Cooper” even though I had no romantic inclination in my life. Second one “Issues - Julia Michaels” and the third “Someone like you - Adele”. Fourth being “All I want - Kodaline”.</p>

<p>4. If you are given a chance to be one one person, who do you want to be?</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want to be any one else. Everyone has their own battles and struggles like I did. I remember Eminem’s lines in “Beautiful”</p>

<p>“But you have to walk a thousand miles, In my shoes, just to see<br>
What it’s like, to be me, I’ll be you, let’s trade shoes<br>
Just to see what it’d be like to, Feel your pain, you feel mine<br>
Go inside each other’s mind, Just to see what we find<br>
Look at shit through each other’s eyes”</p>

<p>5. How has the COVID – 19 pandemic changed your life?</p>

<p>I don’t think it has changed much in my life. I would have stayed unemployed either ways. :P</p>

<p>Now time for some nominations. Most of them I am about to nominate have already received multiple nominations, so I would rather write about their blogs which I adore on this platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>About the first person who reached out to me, and I am glad he did. I have religiously read all his blogs even though I am not a theist. (<a href="https://banterrepublic.blog/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://banterrepublic.blog/</a>)</li>
  <li>I thoroughly enjoy commenting on her short stories and stories based on prompts. She has a very engaging persona which I greatly adore. (<a href="https://thesoulsearchersite.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://thesoulsearchersite.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>There is something quite alluring about her blogs which I cannot describe well with words. Though I have read only few of her works, I have greatly enjoyed them. <a href="https://waywardscribbles.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(https://waywardscribbles.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>I am not going to burden her with more awards, since she has been bestowed with too many. Her illustrations and artwork speak for themselves. Mere words of mine cannot justify her artwork whatsoever.(<a href="https://illustratedbyhannah.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://illustratedbyhannah.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>His uncanny pictures and attention to detail immensely question the little photographic skills I thought I had. (<a href="https://milford-street.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://milford-street.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>He is not only a rare poet, words fit like a structured jigsaw puzzle in his artwork in the name of poems. (<a href="https://shanyu.blog/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://shanyu.blog/</a>)</li>
  <li>Despite being so young, she weaves a story I cannot even imagine in my moment of unwavering focus. (<a href="https://dulcyblogs.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://dulcyblogs.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>Nawazish has a very exciting structure to pen down the thoughts, and very engaging persona with readers. (<a href="https://thelighteningbug.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://thelighteningbug.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>She has a very relatable unfolding of her life events and a great writer in making. (<a href="https://manishasky.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://manishasky.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>She is a well established poet for a reason. There is much to learn whenever I visit her blogs, for her writing is so eloquent and mesmerizing. New writers, here is one of your guiding lights. (<a href="https://musingsbyamedstudent.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://musingsbyamedstudent.wordpress.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>I saved one of the best for the last. And that is you, my reader. Having such a short memory, it is only natural that I have forgotten your important contribution to the blogging sphere. My apologies for I haven’t explicitly stated your name, but you deserve full credit for what you are doing here.</li>
</ul>

<p>To, K, I hope I have answered your questions appropriately. To my regular readers, sorry for the delay caused. I have had some personal events which take a huge chunk of my time, I will get back with a nerve cracking tale. Until then, stay safe from my blogs.</p>

<p>As for the link to my best blogpost would be to any “Error - 404” website on the internet. (:D)</p>

<p>Since I would not be nominating any of them, I would not burden you with any more questions.</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
